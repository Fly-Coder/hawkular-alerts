= Simple Generator

This example creates triggers to fire different severity of alerts based on a random number generated between the values 0 and 10.

* When condition `X >= 1 && X < 5` it is LOW severity (4 numbers, 1-4)
* When condition `X >= 5 && X < 8` it is MEDIUM severity (3 numbers, 5-7)
* When condition `X >= 8 && X < 10` it is HIGH severity (2 numbers, 8-9)
* When condition `X >= 10` it is CRITICAL severity (1 number, 10)

X=0 will not generate an alert.

[NOTE]
====
The scripts are written in groovy to make them work from maven in any platorm but those are pretty simple and can be translated to bash or a different environment easily.
